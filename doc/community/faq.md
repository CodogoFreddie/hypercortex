## How do I delete a task?

> You can't

Currently you can only mark a task as `done`, which will usually hide the task from view.
There is a specific calculator that is used to decide if a task is expired, once all clients that are syncing together have calculated a task to be expired it will be deleted from all peers. You can read more about that [here][expire_calculator]

[expire_calculator]: /core/config#expire_calculator
