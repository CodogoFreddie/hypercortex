# Getting Started

Welcome to `hypertask`, a task manager that's easy to learn and easy to master.

## Picking a Client

Hypertask currently provides two clients: a [cli][cliintro] and a [web app][webintro]. The development team uses both, and there's no _correct_ choice as to which you should use. Both use the same underlying data, and you can even use both at the same time, using hypertask's [syncing][syncintro] functionality.

There's no lock-in to either client, so feel free to experiment with either, safe in the knowledge that you can switch later

## Syncing

Hypertask provides a syncing server program that aims to be as simple as possible to setup and maintain. If you want to sync tasks between multiple devices, you'll need to use this syncing system.
